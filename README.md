# Try the HideDiscoverButton helper theme!
This is a BetterDiscord / Vencord theme to hide the stupid discord discovery button that sits at the bottom of the server list and breaks certain other themes

## Installation 
1. [Download the theme](https://github.com/rondotdll/HideDiscoverButton/raw/refs/heads/main/HideDiscoverButton.theme.css)
2. Enable it on its own or with any other broken themes
